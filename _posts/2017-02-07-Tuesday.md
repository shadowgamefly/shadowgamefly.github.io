## Parrallel Computing

1. Data Dependence
    1. Dependence Graph : Directed graph
2. Data Parallelism: Independent tasks apply same operations to different subset of element, so we can do them concurrently
3. Pipelining
4. Data Clustering: organizing a data set based on "similarity"
    1. data Parallelism
    2. functional parallelism
5. Programming Parallel Computer
    1. Extend compilers: auto-generate parallel Program
        1. detect parallelism opportunity in sequential
        2. produce parallel executable program
        3. focus on work in Fotran
        4. lots of advantages, however unable to retrieve parrallelism
    2. Extend language: add parallel operations
    3. Define new language & compilers
    4. Current Status
6. Task Channel Model
    1. parallel computation = set of taskes
    2. Tasks send message to each other through channel
    3. granalarity : computation vs. communication, avoid message overhead, drive down communication (Tmsg = a(base)+ bytes(send a lot at on time)).
7. Foster's Methodology
    1. problem Partitions
        1. domain decomposition: divide data, determine concurrency
        2. functional decomposition: complicated
    2. communication
    3. agglomeration
        1. group tasks into larger tasks
        2. improve performace; maintain scalability; simplify
