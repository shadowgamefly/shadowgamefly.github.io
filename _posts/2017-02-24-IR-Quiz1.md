## Lecture I: Intro

* Why IR
    * Due to information overload
    * Unstructured data

* Main topics
    * Search Engine Arch
    * Retrieval models
    * Evaluations
    * feedback
    * link analysis
    * Search applications

* Core Concepts
  * Query representation
    * lexical gap
    * Semantic gap
  * Document representation
    * data structure for access
    * handle lexical + semantic gap
  * Retrieval model
    * based on the query give **most relevant** result back

  * IR vs DB
  * IR vs NLP


## Lecture II: Search Engine Architecture

* Paper to read: **The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine**

* Key parts:
  * Crawler and indexer
  * Document Analyzer
  * Query parser
  * Ranking model

* Flow path:
  * query side:
    * user input -> Query parser -> ranking model -> domain db -> result preprocessing -> result display
  * document side:
    * crawler & indexer -> Document Analyzer & Auxiliary database

* Another looking:
  * crawler -> Doc Analyzer -> indexer ->
  * Query -> Query Rep ->
  * Combined to -> ranker -> result
  * Receive feedback -> modify ranker & Query Rep

* Key concepts
  * Information need
  * Query
  * Document
  * Relevance
  * **rank documents by their relevance to user's Information need**
  * Web crawler
  * Document Analyzer & indexer
      * manage crawled content and provide efficient access
  * Query parser
      * compile user input into comp. rep.
  * Ranking model
      * sort the candidate documents by its relevancy to the given query
  * Result Display
      * Present the retrieved results
  * Retrieval Evaluation
      * Assess the quality of the result
  * Relevance feedback
      * propagate the judgment back to the system to improve performance
  * Search Query log
      * record user's interaction with the system
  * User modeling
      * Assess user's satisfaction with the search engine
      * understand user longitude info need
  * Search Style
      * Browsing -- Browse all categories
      * Querying -- Completely based on user query
  * Pull vs Push
      * Pull, with query -- user with initiative pull info out
      * push, without query -- system push info out based on user log
